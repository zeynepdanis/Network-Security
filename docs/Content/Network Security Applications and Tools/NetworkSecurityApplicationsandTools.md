## Importance of Basic Security Practices: Firewalls, Antiviruses, and IDS/IPS

### Brief Overview of Firewall Types and Their Importance

Firewalls are a crucial part of computer network security, controlling traffic within or outside a private network. They analyze incoming packets based on predetermined rules, determining permitted or denied traffic. Acting as gateways or gatekeepers managing permissible and restricted web activity within a private network, firewalls create choke points for web traffic. These points undergo scrutiny based on a series of programmed parameters to govern subsequent actions. Some firewalls also monitor traffic and connections in audit logs for reference regarding permissions or denials. Primarily, firewalls are used to fortify the borders of a private network or its core devices, falling under the umbrella of access control for heightened security.

Types of firewalls:

1. **Packet Filtering Firewalls:** They filter incoming packets based on attributes like source and destination addresses, port numbers, and protocol types. Filtering is not content-based but relies on packet characteristics, making this method the simplest and most economical for filtering network traffic.

2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls:** These systems not only filter packets but also monitor the state of network traffic. This includes information about whether a connection is open or closed, its direction, duration, and more. This data enables more effective filtering of network traffic.

3. **Application Layer Firewalls:** These filters operate at the application layer and scrutinize traffic based on packet content. Consequently, they're the most effective method for filtering network traffic. However, they require more resources and are typically more expensive.

4. **Circuit-Level Gateways:** Filtering at the circuit level, these firewalls operate based on packet content rather than the source or destination. They are the simplest and most economical method for filtering traffic but are less effective.

**Why are Firewalls Necessary ?** 

Firewalls bolster security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. Their primary task involves regulating data traffic between devices accessing a computer network, thwarting unwanted traffic.
