# INTRODUCTION

Computer networks are areas where critical and sensitive data is stored, communications take place, and transactions are conducted, which are of crucial importance for organizations, institutions, and individuals. In this context, strategies, applications, tools, and policies of network security play a vital role in ensuring the protection and security of these valuable pieces of information.

Network security is a vast domain that requires multifaceted approaches. A successful network security strategy encompasses various elements, forming a robust structure through their integration.

Strategies represent the general approaches used in the field of network security. Firstly, identifying security vulnerabilities in network structures, assessing and evaluating risks hold strategic importance. Subsequently, taking preventive measures against these risks, closing security gaps, and strengthening defense mechanisms become imperative.

Applications refer to the tools, software, and processes that enable the practical implementation of network security strategies. Applications like firewalls, antivirus software, security patches, encryption methods are fundamental components in ensuring network security.

Tools represent the technological hardware and software solutions used for network security. Tools such as network monitoring and analysis tools, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and authentication systems play an effective role in maintaining network security.

Policies encompass the decisions, rules, and procedures related to an organization's network security. A robust policy establishes standards for network security, provides training for employees, and sets a framework for reporting and rectifying security vulnerabilities.

The integration of these elements allows for the effective formulation and implementation of network security strategies. However, due to technological advancements, security threats constantly evolve, necessitating a continually updated and improved process. This report aims to deeply examine and effectively utilize network security strategies, applications, tools, and policies.
