They analyze incoming packets based on predetermined rules, determining permitted or denied traffic. Acting as gateways or gatekeepers managing permissible and restricted web activity within a private network, firewalls create choke points for web traffic. These points undergo scrutiny based on a series of programmed parameters to govern subsequent actions. Some firewalls also monitor traffic and connections in audit logs for reference regarding permissions or denials. Primarily, firewalls are used to fortify the borders of a private network or its core devices, falling under the umbrella of access control for heightened security.</p> <p>Types of firewalls:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Packet Filtering Firewalls: They filter incoming packets based on attributes like source and destination addresses, port numbers, and protocol types. Filtering is not content-based but relies on packet characteristics, making this method the simplest and most economical for filtering network traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stateful Inspection Firewalls: These systems not only filter packets but also monitor the state of network traffic. This includes information about whether a connection is open or closed, its direction, duration, and more. This data enables more effective filtering of network traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Application Layer Firewalls: These filters operate at the application layer and scrutinize traffic based on packet content. Consequently, they're the most effective method for filtering network traffic. However, they require more resources and are typically more expensive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Circuit-Level Gateways: Filtering at the circuit level, these firewalls operate based on packet content rather than the source or destination. They are the simplest and most economical method for filtering traffic but are less effective.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Why are Firewalls Necessary ? </p> <p>Firewalls bolster security by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. Their primary task involves regulating data traffic between devices accessing a computer network, thwarting unwanted traffic. Hence, firewalls are pivotal in safeguarding computer systems and networks. Several reasons underscore the necessity of firewalls:</p> <ul> <li>Prevention of Malicious Software: Firewalls prevent harmful software from infiltrating systems, averting damage caused by viruses, worms, and trojans.</li> <li>Ensuring Network Security: They protect networks by intercepting requests from unsafe sources, shielding against hackers, spyware, and cyber attacks.</li> <li>Preventing Data Leakage: By thwarting external infiltration, firewalls secure stored data, safeguarding against data breaches.</li> <li>Legal Compliance: For certain sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance, law), adherence to specific security standards is mandatory. Firewalls ensure compliance with these standards.</li> <li>Enhancing Network Performance: By blocking harmful traffic, firewalls optimize network performance, facilitating faster operations.</li> <li>Simplified System Management: Firewalls streamline tasks like monitoring, reporting, and managing network traffic for administrators, enabling more efficient security measures.</li> </ul> <p>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Firewall</p> <ol> <li>Identifying Requirements: Clear identification of the threats you need protection against (e.g., viruses, malware, spam, trojans) is crucial.</li> <li>Performance: The firewall's performance should match the size and traffic of your network.</li> <li>Ease of Use: User-friendly interfaces facilitate effective firewall utilization and management.</li> <li>Features: Look for desired features like application layer filtering, VPN support, antivirus, IDS/IPS.</li> <li>Reliability: Consider the credibility of the manufacturer, their support, and update services.</li> </ol> <p>Firewall Software tools  Examples:</p> <p>Various brands offer different firewall features and solutions.

Initially, they were used primarily to detect and remove basic but harmful viruses like trojans. However, as technology advanced, they evolved to combat more complex and varied forms of malicious software and attack methods, becoming more intricate in their operations. Modern antivirus programs aim not only to detect viruses but also to identify and eliminate various potential threats.</p> <p>They can detect various types of malicious software, including ransomware, spyware, trojans, worms, malware that engages in cryptocurrency mining, malicious software that can turn your computer into a zombie machine, and identity theft-related malware. These different forms of malware often cause significant problems, especially in the corporate sector. Today's antivirus programs strive to identify and eliminate such threats.</p> <p>How do they work? Antivirus programs typically possess extensive databases of known malicious software signatures. These databases are regularly updated as new vulnerabilities or software are discovered to ensure customers are protected against current threats. When antivirus programs encounter a malicious software on a system they're scanning, they compare its digital signature, known as a 'hash,' with examples in their signature-based database. If a match is found, indicating a known malicious software, the antivirus software removes it from the computer. However, detecting new viruses that aren't in signature databases remains an area of ongoing development. Antivirus programs today also use various features to detect anomalies within systems or file directories, alerting users and halting ongoing processes that might indicate potential threats.</p> <p>Antivirus Software Tools Some of the popular antivirus software used in Turkey and around the world include:</p> <ul> <li>ESET: Known for reliability and effective virus detection while using low system resources.</li> <li>Kaspersky: Renowned for a wide range of features, strong virus detection, and protection against online threats.</li> <li>Bitdefender: Recognized for effective virus protection, minimal performance impact, and a user-friendly interface.</li> <li>Norton: Strong history in protecting online privacy, detecting malicious software, and preventing zero-day attacks.</li> <li>Avast: Widely used for its free version, real-time protection, user-friendly interface, and additional tools.</li> <li>McAfee: Known for its comprehensive feature set, protection against online threats, and user-friendly interface.</li> <li>F-Secure: Trusted for online privacy protection, malware detection, and ease of use.</li> <li>AVG:  Known for its free version and offering a broad range of protection with a user-friendly interface and real-time protection.</li> </ul> <p>Here's the comparison of these antivirus software in a table format:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Content/Network%20Security%20Applications%20and%20Tools/NetworkSecurityApplicationsandTools/#what-are-the-differences-between-a-firewall-and-antivirus-software","title":"What are the differences between a firewall and antivirus software?","text":"<p>Firewalls and antivirus software are two different security tools used to protect computers from malicious software.

Information is encrypted as it travels from one point to another and can only be deciphered by the recipient possessing the correct key.</p> <p>Tunneling: VPNs create a secure communication pathway known as a \"tunnel.\" This enables data packets to be securely sent and received. The tunnel establishes the infrastructure necessary for securely transmitting data.</p> <p>Remote Access: VPNs allow remote or geographically dispersed users to securely access the company network. This ensures data security while navigating through security firewalls and other protective measures.</p> <p>Authentication and Authorization: VPNs are typically equipped with authentication methods. Various security protocols are used to authenticate users' identities and allow access only to authorized individuals.</p> <p>VPNs can be used within corporate networks, for secure remote access by employees, or to protect sensitive data. They're also utilized to establish secure connections on public networks, like public Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Internet users can use VPN tools to encrypt internet traffic and maintain their privacy.
